## Features
- Detects various types of distracted driving behaviors, such as texting, talking on the phone, eating, drinking, grooming, and more.
- Utilizes computer vision algorithms to analyze uploaded images and extract relevant features for classification.
- Applies machine learning models to classify the detected behaviors into predefined categories.
- Provides an intuitive interface for users to upload and analyze images.

## Model and Dataset
The sentiment analysis model is trained using logistic regression on a labeled dataset of tweets. The dataset consists of tweets collected from various sources and manually annotated with sentiment labels. The logistic regression model is used to predict the sentiment of new, unseen tweets.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- **Web Framework** :- Streamlit(A Python framework for building interactive web applications)
- **Libraries for sentiment analysis** :- NLTK(Natural Language Toolkit for text processing and sentiment analysis)
- Scikit-learn: Used for training the logistic regression model and performing sentiment analysis.
- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: Used for data visualization.
