## Features

- Input a Twitter handle or hashtag to retrieve recent tweets.
- Perform sentiment analysis on the retrieved tweets.
- Visualize the sentiment distribution using pie charts or bar plots.
- Display the most frequently used words in positive and negative tweets.
- Explore the sentiment analysis results and gain insights.

## Model and Dataset
The sentiment analysis model is trained using logistic regression on a labeled dataset of tweets. The dataset consists of tweets collected from various sources and manually annotated with sentiment labels. The logistic regression model is used to predict the sentiment of new, unseen tweets.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- **Web Framework** :- Streamlit(A Python framework for building interactive web applications)
- **Libraries for sentiment analysis** :- NLTK(Natural Language Toolkit for text processing and sentiment analysis)
- Scikit-learn: Used for training the logistic regression model and performing sentiment analysis.
- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: Used for data visualization.
